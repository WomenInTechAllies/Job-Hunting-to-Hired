Huge thank you to Robert Half for bringing their A game and making this such an informative and empowering event.

The sample resumes from this workshop and the slide deck are here for you.

## A note from Robert Half:

Everyone on my entire team that attended last night loved the event & felt very rewarded to give advice, share what resumes & linkedin profiles work… as well as advising people how to interview the “right way.” 

We all walked away feeling like we helped in some small way & we hope the response from the attendee’s is the same. So thank you & Robert Half is honored to partner with WIT Allies! We hope to continue this partnership FOREVER!!!

I have included all the names, emails & linkedin profiles of the Robert Half recruiters & account executives that spoke last night, so please feel free to share this with the group & tell the attendee’s to reach out at anytime!
